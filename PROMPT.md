ok, currently we are using transcribe-translate pipeline. problem is for korean and english direction is vise versa. so while i am speaking and not finishing sentence, and trying to translate in the middle, the translation is often very wrong. so in order to improve, i suggest the following improvlement. we will keep the current one as is. we will introduce new config. it only works under transcribe-trnaslate pipeline. new config will toggle between current behavior and new behavior. the new behavior description is following. we will transcribe as fast. 1000 is good. we will have two windows horizontally positioned. when new transcription comes, we will display in the left box. and then we will have to figure out the transcript contains the full sentence.  most likely they are not going to be a full sentence. we will have to send to LLM to check if it has full sentence. (checking chronological order). display full sentences on the transcript box. and cut the rest (not sentence) into the buffer. then when next transcript comes, add that into the buffer and do the same process of sending it to LLM and separate out full sentense and non-finished letters. so after LLM sentence determination is done, display the transcriptions, but make new line for the complete sentences, and just add inline for non complete letters. then send completed sentences to translate LLM model for full sentence translation, then show that to the right translation box. also make toggle ui to visually display or hide the transcription box.
